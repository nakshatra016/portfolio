    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="about">
      <p>Hey! I’m Nakshatra Ramakrishnan, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Data Science. I’m deeply fascinated by the power of data and its potential to drive intelligent decisions, innovation, and impactful change.</p>

      <p>Currently, I serve as the Associate Lead - Curation at TEDx SRMIST, where I collaborate with an incredible team to bring inspiring ideas to life. I work on the TEDx motto "Ideas worth Spreading". This role has strengthened my leadership, storytelling, and analytical skills — qualities I carry into my technical journey as well.</p>

      <p>My interests lie at the intersection of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering. I enjoy exploring how data pipelines, analytics, and AI models can be built to solve real-world problems efficiently. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and striving to build a career where data meets purpose.</p>
